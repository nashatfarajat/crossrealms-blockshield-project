# AI Integration of BlockShield Project

This repository contains the code and report for Task 2 of the BlockShield project, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and clustering of IP behavior from network logs.

## Files

- **Task 2 â€“ AI Integration of BlockShield Project.pdf**  
  Detailed report explaining the analysis of the dataset, clustering approach and results.

- **Cowrie EDA & Clustering.ipynb**  
  Jupyter notebook with the complete code for data preprocessing, feature extraction from timestamps, scaling, and KMeans clustering of IPs.

## Summary

- Aggregated event-level data by IP to create behavior-based features.  
- Applied KMeans clustering to group IPs based on activity patterns.  
- Achieved a silhouette score of 0.61, indicating well-separated and meaningful clusters.

## Usage

Open the Jupyter notebook to review and run the analysis step-by-step.
