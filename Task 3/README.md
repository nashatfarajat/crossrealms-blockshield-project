# BlockShield Project — Initial ML-Based Intrusion Detection


This file contains the initial machine learning models for intrusion detection using the 5G-NIDD dataset. The models aim to detect and classify various network attacks.

## Included Files

- **IDS PCA 5G-NIDD.ipynb** — PCA-based feature reduction and modeling notebook  
- **IDS model - 5G-NIDD.ipynb** — Genetic algorithm feature selection and modeling notebook  
- **Initial ML-Based Intrusion Detection Using the 5G-NIDD Dataset - report.pdf** — Project report summarizing methods, results, and conclusions  

## Overview

The project develops baseline intrusion detection models using two feature reduction methods: PCA and genetic algorithm-based selection. Models were trained and evaluated on the 5G-NIDD dataset using XGBoost and Random Forest classifiers.

## Goal

To automatically identify and classify malicious network activity and benign traffic in 5G networks for enhanced cybersecurity.
